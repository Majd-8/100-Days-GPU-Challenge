# Day 1:
Learned about the basics of parallel computing, a little history about the idea, when it was invented and how it was first introduced, Also learned about the pros and cons of parallel computing and what challenges it faces.

Code:
coded a simple vector addition kernel.

Read:
Chapter 1 of PMPP

# Day 2:
Learned about function declaration in CUDA, how to call and configure a kernel and reviewed some concepts from yesterday and understood it better. For coding, I tried coding a 2-d vector multiplication.

Code:
2-D vector multiplication kernel.

# Day 3:
Learned about multidimensional grid organization how its matched with the dimensions of data and learned about memory space and how to map  threads with data points giving that multidimesional arrays are all flattened and studied an example of converting a RGB image to gray scale.

Code:
matrix multiplication kernel.
