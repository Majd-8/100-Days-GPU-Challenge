# Day 1:
Learned about the basics of parallel computing, a little history about the idea, when it was invented and how it was first introduced, Also learned about the pros and cons of parallel computing and what challenges it faces.

Code:
coded a simple vector addition kernel.

Read:
Chapter 1 of PMPP


---


# Day 2:
Learned about function declaration in CUDA, how to call and configure a kernel and reviewed some concepts from yesterday and understood it better. For coding, I tried coding a 2-d vector multiplication.

Code:
2-D vector multiplication kernel.
https://github.com/Majd-8/100-Days-GPU-Challenge/blob/main/Code/Day%202/Vector%20Multiplication.cu

Read:
Chapter 2 of PMPP

# Day 3:
Learned about multidimensional grid organization how its matched with the dimensions of data and learned about memory space and how to map  threads with data points giving that multidimesional arrays are all flattened and studied an example of converting a RGB image to gray scale.

Code:
matrix multiplication kernel.
https://github.com/Majd-8/100-Days-GPU-Challenge/blob/main/Code/Day%203/MatrixMultiplication.cu

Read:
part of chapter 3 of PMPP


---


# Day 4:
Revised some of the key concepts I learned in the past three days and checked multiple code examples. Also watched a tutorial on C programming language basics since I don't have prior knowledge in C and learned more about its syntax and basic functions.

Code:
matrix addition kernel.
https://github.com/Majd-8/100-Days-GPU-Challenge/blob/main/Code/Day%204/MatrixAddition.cu

Read:
Some online aricles and blogs with CUDA code examples.


---


# Day 5:
Learned more about mapping threads to multidimensional data.
Studied more complex examples as image blurring and matrix multiplication.

Code:
Image blurring kernel.
https://github.com/Majd-8/100-Days-GPU-Challenge/blob/main/Code/Day%205/Image%20Blur.cu

Read:
finished chapter 3 of PMPP.


---


# Day 6:
Learned about modern GPUs architecture and how blocks and threads are scheduled.

Code:
Matrix multiplication kernel where each thread produce one output matrix row (Chapter 3 exercises).
https://github.com/Majd-8/100-Days-GPU-Challenge/blob/main/Code/Day%206/Matrix%20Multiplication%202.cu

Read:
Chapter 4 of PMPP.
